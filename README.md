# Iot-air-waste-monitor-system
In the present situation, a large portion of the urban communities, the flooded rubbish containers making an unhealthy condition. This garbage compartments leads to air pollution as they release harmfull gases like CO2, smoke, liquor, benzene and NH3. In order to monitor this situation we propose a model which is IoT based waste and air quality monitoring system. This system will reflect on the facts of monitoring garbage and air quality system in which we will display the trash quantity and air quality over a web server and will send a message when the garbage is full or air quality goes down beyond the threshold level, means when there are adequate amount of harmful gases are present in the air.

**The system was made using-**\
Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, MQ-135 Air Quality Gas Sensor, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module which all are greatly available and low cost.\
